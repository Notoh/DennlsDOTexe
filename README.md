# DennlsDOTexe
the meme

# NOTE FOR PEOPLE LOOKING AT THIS: 
I don't encourage cheating, this client was made solely for the meme (basically a guy named Dennls got caught cheating in a game I played and it was really really funny watching him deny it so someone dared me to make this). There is no build of this for a reason, but if you are so desperate for hacks that you build one yourself that is (a) depressing and (b) why would you do that when you can use actually good hacks?

## Features:

click gui

lots of hacks (some will bypass no guarantees)

This client works in 3 modes, Ghost, Safe and Blatant

Ghost mode hides all the GUIs and also modifies the values of KillAura, Speed notably among others.

Safe is designed to be slightly less blatant than blatant, but the GUIs will show up and also the values of KA and speed are slightly higher.

Blatant basically says I don't care about getting banned, I'm going to use my 8 block reach if its the last thing I do!
